Dear Daniel Rinzler:

I am writing regarding any internship positions available at Raytheon for Summer 2018. I received your contact through Jim Woods, a colleague of my father. Currently, I am pursing a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Electrical Engineering at the University of Michigan and I plan to graduate in April 2020. Outside of academics, I am a member of the Michigan Hyperloop project team working on the brakes subsystem. I am looking for an internship to gain additional exposure to mechanical engineering and practice what I have learned in the classroom to real life applications.

One of my team members in the \textit{Design and Manufacturing} class I am currently taking interned at Raytheon last summer at the Fullerton, CA branch. Although his internship focused more on electrical engineering aspects rather than mechanical engineering, he was able to gain valuable insight into applications of engineering principles while learning a new set of skills. I think that an internship would be beneficial to my growth as an engineer as Raytheon designs next generation technology. A team at the El Segundo branch I can see myself interning with is the Antenna and Electronic Susbsystem. Working on this team would allow me to expand on both of my areas of study. Some other teams at the El Segundo branch which interest me are the IRAD/CRAD space programs. Working for these teams would expand my expertise in FEA analysis for thermal calculations. These are important skills for a Mechanical Engineer to have and putting them to use in an industry setting will cement my learning.

I believe that my combination of skills and experience make me a great fit for an internship at Raytheon. I appreciate your time and consideration, and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Sincerely,
